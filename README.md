# Wake Word Detection üéôÔ∏è

This project introduces a real-time system capable of detecting wake words using a neural network model that processes 2-second audio spectrograms.

---

## Project Overview üöÄ

The wake word detection system follows a streamlined workflow:

1. **Data Collection**: Background noise and wake word audio data were collected, supplemented by the UrbanSound8K dataset.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Extensive data augmentation techniques were applied to increase the sample diversity.
3. **Generator Creation**: A specialized generator was developed to convert audio files into spectrograms, integrating optimizations such as batch normalization and preemphasis.
4. **Model Training**: A neural network model was trained using the preprocessed data and saved for future use.
5. **Real-Time Prediction**: A script was deployed to continuously capture 1-second audio chunks, with the last 2 seconds used for model prediction.
